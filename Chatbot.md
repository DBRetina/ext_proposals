# Proposal: Integrating DBRetina with an LLM-Powered Chatbot for Genomic Data Exploration  



## **Introduction to DBRetina**  

**DBRetina** is a high-performance bioinformatics tool with an efficient linear algorithm for calculating the pairwise distance among large collections of gene sets. This algorithim enables easy construction a comprehensive pairwise molecular
similarity network within and across several molecular databases. To enable efficient search and visualization of this huge similarity network, DBRetina can transform the final output into format compatible with the Neo4j graph databases. 

**Challenge**: While DBRetina bridges genomic analytics and graph databases, querying Neo4j requires **Cypher query language expertise**, limiting accessibility for non-technical researchers.  



## **Proposed Solution: LLM-Driven Chatbot for Natural Language to Cypher**  

A chatbot that translates natural language questions into Cypher queries, enabling intuitive interaction with DBRetina-generated Neo4j graphs.  

### **Chatbot Architecture**  

#### 1. **Natural Language Interface**  
- **Input**: Researchers ask questions in plain English (e.g., *"Which genes are linked to both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's?"*).  
- **LLM Backbone**: Uses **GPT-4 Turbo**, fine-tuned with:  
  - DBRetina’s Neo4j schema (node labels, relationships, properties).  
  - Example Cypher queries (training data for intent recognition).  

#### 2. **Schema-Aware Query Generation**  
- **Dynamic Schema Retrieval**: The chatbot fetches the Neo4j schema to ensure queries align with existing nodes (e.g., `Disease`, `Gene`) and relationships (e.g., `ASSOCIATED_WITH`).  
- **Example Mapping**:  
  - *User Query*: "Find diseases sharing genes with breast cancer."  
  - **Generated Cypher**:  
    ```cypher
    MATCH (d1:Disease {name: "Breast Cancer"})-[:SHARES_GENE]->(g:Gene)<-[:SHARES_GENE]-(d2:Disease)  
    RETURN d2.name, COUNT(g) AS shared_genes ORDER BY shared_genes DESC  
    ```  

#### 3. **Self-Correcting Mechanism**  
- **Error Handling**: If a query fails, the chatbot:  
  1. Captures the Neo4j error (e.g., invalid label).  
  2. Automatically revises the query using the LLM’s feedback loop.  

#### 4. **Integration with DBRetina Outputs**  
- Directly connects to Neo4j instances populated by DBRetina’s exported data.  
- Supports real-time exploration of gene-disease networks.  



## **Benefits & Impact**  

| **Feature**               | **Advantage**                                                                 |  
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Accessibility**          | Enables non-technical users to query complex genomic networks.               |  
| **Efficiency**             | Reduces query-writing time by ~70% (based on LLM benchmarks ).                |  
| **Scalability**            | Adapts to evolving graph schemas and supports multi-database integration.     |  

**Use Case**: A researcher investigating genetic links between autoimmune diseases could ask:  
> *"Show me diseases connected to Rheumatoid Arthritis via at least 10 shared genes."*  

**Result**: The chatbot generates a Cypher query to retrieve and rank relevant diseases, accelerating hypothesis testing.  



## **Future Steps**  
1. **Validation**: Benchmark performance using DisGeNET and clinical trial datasets.  
2. **Multimodal Queries**: Extend support for temporal or spatial genomic patterns (e.g., gene expression over time).  
3. **User Interface**: Develop a web-based frontend for seamless integration with DBRetina’s workflow.
